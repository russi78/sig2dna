## Introduction

In the realm of data analysis, the ability to represent complex signals in a simplified format is crucial. The **sig2dna** project aims to bridge the gap between analytical signals and DNA-like representations. By converting signals into a symbolic format, researchers and practitioners can apply advanced techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence for better insights.

This project finds applications in various fields such as:

- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing biological data through signal processing.
- **Chemometrics**: Extracting information from chemical data.
- **NMR Spectroscopy**: Interpreting nuclear magnetic resonance data.
- **Chromatography**: Analyzing mixtures and compounds.

## Features

- **Signal Alignment**: Align signals for better comparison and analysis.
- **Classification**: Classify signals based on their symbolic representation.
- **Blind Source Separation**: Separate mixed signals into their original components.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns in time-series data.
- **Wavelet Transform**: Apply wavelet techniques for signal analysis.
- **X-ray Diffraction Analysis**: Process and analyze diffraction patterns.

## Installation

To install the **sig2dna** package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/russi78/sig2dna.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

## Usage

To use the **sig2dna** functionality, follow the examples below. Ensure that you have the necessary data files in the correct format.

### Example 1: Signal Transformation

```python
from sig2dna import transform_signal

signal_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Example signal data
dna_code = transform_signal(signal_data)
print(dna_code)
```

### Example 2: Signal Classification

```python
from sig2dna import classify_signal

dna_code = "ACGTACGT"  # Example DNA code
classification = classify_signal(dna_code)
print(classification)
```
