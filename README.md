**Symbolic Signal Transformation for Fingerprinting, Alignment, and AI-Based Classification**

 ﹏ ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ـﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ـ﹏﹏

>`sig2dna` is a Python module that transforms **complex 1D analytical signals** into **DNA-like symbolic sequences** via morphological encoding. These symbolic fingerprints enable fast alignment, motif recognition, classification, and high-throughput comparison of signals originating from:
>
>- `GC-MS` / `GC-FID` - 🔍low and🔬high resolution
>- `HPLC-MS`  - 🔍low and🔬high resolution
>- `NMR` / `FTIR` / `Raman` / `RX`

It supports **large-scale applications** such as identifying unknown substances in ♻️ recycled materials or mixtures containing **NIAS** (*Non-Intentionally Added Substances*). 🗜️ Symbolic compression (up to 95%+) enables scalable storage and alignment—and seamless integration with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

💡 **Note for ND-signals and multi-detector or multi-technique data**

`sig2dna` natively supports signal alignment and comparison across heterogeneous sources. This makes it particularly suited for **ND-signals** (*non-destructive signals*) or **aggregated data** from different detectors or acquisition techniques.

➡️ You can seamlessly concatenate or compare signals originating from **different instruments or modes** (e.g., UV + MS, GC×GC, LC-FTIR, etc.) — the symbolic coding abstracts away intensity scales and detector-specific artifacts, focusing instead on **morphological motifs**.

## 🧬 3| **Core Concepts** - Overview



> **Morphology Encoding as a “Genetic” Code**. Chemical signals are subjected to signal morphology encoding using continuous, symmetric wavelet transforms. The symbolic sequences are similar to genetic code. It is based on a limited number of letters,  symbols appear grouped into motifs which behave like  codons  As a result, a motif table can be used to recognize n-upplets in ^1^H-NMR, mass spectra, retention times, etc. 
>
> **Motif Recognition.** Searches of substances or typical patterns can be carried out via regular expressions or via transition probabilities (A→Z vs. Z→B vs. A→A) over a sliding window. All operations can be carried out in parallel for efficiency and automated treatment.
>
> **Scalable Machine-Learning**. High compression ratios enable the efficient storage of millions of chemical signatures. 



### 3.1 **Input Signa**l ➡️

- One-dimensional `signal` objects (NumPy-based)
- Supports synthetic and experimental sources

```python
S = signal.from_peaks(...)
```



### 3.2 **Wavelet Transform** 〰

A **Mexican hat (Ricker)** wavelet is used:

$$
\psi_s(t) = \left(1 - \frac{t^2}{s^2}\right)e^{-\frac{t^2}{2s^2}}
$$

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of a signal $x(t)$ is:

$$
W_s(t) = x(t)*\psi_s(t) = \int x(\tau) \cdot \psi_s(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

where $s$ is the scale parameter (typically powers of two, e.g., $s = 2^n$) and $*$ the convolution operator.



### 3.3 **Relationship of $W_s(t)$ with the second derivative** $x''(t)=\frac{\partial^2 x(t)}{\partial t^2}$

Applying the **Ricker wavelet (second derivative of a Gaussian**) to the signal $x(t)$ via convolution (i.e., CWT) is equivalent to computing the **second derivative of $x(t)$** smoothed by the Gaussian kernel $g_s(t)$:

$$
W_s(t) = x(t)*\psi_s(t) = x(t) * g''(t) = x''(t) * g(t)
$$

<details>
    <summary>Click here for the demonstration</summary>


The **convolution** of $x(t)$ with the second derivative of $g(t)$ is:

$(x * g'')(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) g''(t - \tau) \, d\tau$

We perform a **change of variable**: let $u = t - \tau$, so $\tau = t - u$ and $d\tau = -du$. This gives:

$(x * g'')(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t - u) g''(u) \, du$

Now consider the convolution of the **second derivative of $x(t)$** with $g(t)$:

$(x'' * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x''(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau$

Again, perform the **change of variable** $u = t - \tau$, yielding:

$(x'' * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x''(t - u) g(u) \, du$



*Now integrate by parts twice*:

* **First integration by parts** (assuming $g(u) \to 0$ and $x'(t - u) \to 0$ as $u \to \pm \infty$):

$\int x''(t - u) g(u) \, du = - \int x'(t - u) g'(u) \, du$

* **Second integration by part**s:

$-\int x'(t - u) g'(u) \, du = \int x(t - u) g''(u) \, du$

Which yields:

$(x'' * g)(t) = \int x(t - u) g''(u) \, du = (x * g'')(t)$

</details>



### 3.4 **Symbolic Encoding** 🔡

Each segment of the wavelet-transformed signal is encoded into one of the symbolic codes corresponding to the table of variation $\text{sign}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}W_s(t)\right)$ and $\text{sign}\left(W_s(t)\right)$.

| Symbol: $\ell_i$ | Variation | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | :-------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>A</kbd>     |    -↗+    | Increasing crossing from − to + (zero-crossing) |
| <kbd>B</kbd>     |    -↗-    | Increasing negative                             |
| <kbd>C</kbd>     |    +↗+    | Increasing positive                             |
| <kbd>X</kbd>     |    +↘+    | Decreasing positive                             |
| <kbd>Y</kbd>     |   -↘\-    | Decreasing negative                             |
| <kbd>Z</kbd>     |    +↘-    | Decreasing crossing from + to − (zero-crossing) |
| <kbd>_</kbd>     |    ──     | Flat or noise segment                           |

Each segment stores its `width`, `height`, and `position`. 

> The full-resolution symbolic sequence is reconstructed by interpolating or repeating these symbols proportionally to their span. A quantitative pseudo-inverse is proposed to reconstruct chemical signals from their code.



### 3.5 **Symbolic Compression** 🗜️

Symbolic sequences can be compressed and encoded at full resolution via:

```python
dna.encode_dna()
dna.encode_dna_full(resolution="index")
```

Resulting in DNA-like sequences like:

```text
"YYAAZZBB_YAZB"
```



### 3.6 **Structural Meaning** (e.g., <kbd>Y</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd><kbd>B</kbd> Motif)

A single Gaussian peak transformed via the Ricker wavelet results in:

- <kbd>Y</kbd>: rising pre-lobe ꒷꒦꒷꒦꒷꒦꒷꒦꒷꒦꒷
- <kbd>A</kbd>: left inflection (− to + crossing)
- <kbd>Z</kbd>: right inflection (+ to − crossing)
- <kbd>B</kbd>: trailing decay

The `YAZB` motif is a **symbolic map of the Ricker wavelet transform (CWT) of a Gaussian**.  An alteration of the pattern  reveals overlapping Gaussians ,  asymmetric signals or more generally interactions and interferences.



### 3.7 **Interpretation When Gaussians Overlap** 🌈⃤

When two Gaussians overlap, especially at close proximity or with different amplitudes:

1. The **central peak becomes asymmetric**.
2. The **Ricker transform** becomes a **superposition** of two wavelets.
3. This causes:
   - Emergence of **extra inflection points**,
   - Distortion of the clean <kbd>Y</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd><kbd>B</kbd>  sequence,
   - Insertion of intermediary motifs (e.g., repeating <kbd>A</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> transitions, shortened or elongated lobes),
   - Possible merging of <kbd>Y</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd><kbd>B</kbd> motifs or partial truncation.

So **changes in the symbolic code structure** directly reflect **signal interference**, i.e., **nonlinearity in overlapping peaks**.

## 🧠 4| **Entropy and Distance Metrics**

`Sig2dna` implements several metrics to evaluate the similarity of coded chemical signals. Alignment is essential to compare them while respecting order. It is performed via global/local pairwise alignment using `difflib` or `Biopython`. Excess Entropy and Jensen-Shannon are best choices in the presence of complex mixtures by enabling the detection of small structural changes.  

| Distance           | Sensitive to | Based on           | Alignment needed | Suitable for                          |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Excess Entropy** | Symbol order | Shannon entropy    | ✅ Yes            | Structural motif similarity           |
| **Jensen-Shannon** | Symbol usage | Probability dist.  | ❌ No             | Profile similarity (e.g., peak types) |
| **Levenshtein**    | Edit steps   | Insertion/Deletion | ✅ Yes            | Sequence-level variation              |
| **Jaccard**        | Pattern sets | Motif occurrences  | ❌ No             | Motif overlap, Motif density map      |



### 4.1 **Shannon Entropy** ⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅

Entropy provides a **robust, physics-informed metric** for morphological comparisons.  For a symbolic sequence $X$, it reads:
$$
H(X) = -\sum_i p(\ell_i) \log_2 p(\ell_i)
$$

where $p(\ell_i)$ is the frequency of letter $l_i$ in the sequence $X$.

Entropy $H$ is an extensive quantity verify additivity properties for independent sequences. Its value is accumulated between structured and low structured regions. Entropy is **invariant under translation and stable under small perturbations**, especially when using symbolic codes rather than raw intensities. This makes it ideal for comparing:

- Signals with **shifts in baseline**
- Morphologically similar but **intensity-scaled** signals
- **Partially distorted** sequences (e.g., from mixtures or degradation)



### 4.2 **Aligned sequences and Excess Entropy Distance**  ↔️

Let $A$ and $B$ be two symbolic sequences (`DNAstr`) representing two signals. After alignment (*e.g.,* via global/local pairwise alignment using `difflib` or `Biopython`), we obtain:

- $\tilde{A}$: aligned version of $A$ (with possible gap insertions)

- $\tilde{B}$: aligned version of $B$

- $\tilde{A} * \tilde{B}$: a new sequence formed by pairing corresponding symbols (possibly with gaps)

  

Given sequences $A$ and $B$, the mutually exclusive information or excess entropy is defined as:

$$
D_{\text{excess}}(A, B) = H(A) + H(B) - 2 H(\tilde{A} * \tilde{B})
$$

where:

- $H(A)$ and $H(B)$ are the Shannon entropies of the original sequences
- $H(\tilde{A} * \tilde{B})$ is the Shannon entropy of the aligned signal pairs (treated as "joint letters")




### 4.3 **Jensen-Shannon Distance** ↔️

Let $P$ and $Q$ be the **empirical frequency distributions** of symbolic letters in two DNA-like coded signals $A$ and $B$, respectively. That is:

* $P = {p_\ell}$ where $p_\ell = \frac{\text{count of symbol } \ell \text{ in } A}{|A|}$
* $Q = {q_\ell}$ where $q_\ell = \frac{\text{count of symbol } \ell \text{ in } B}{|B|}$

Let $M$ be the average distribution:

$$
M = \frac{1}{2}(P + Q)
$$

Then, the **Jensen–Shannon distance** between $P$ and $Q$ is defined as:

$$
D_{\text{JS}}(P, Q) = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(P \| M) + \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(Q \| M) }
$$

where $D_{\text{KL}}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

$$
D_{\text{KL}}(P \| M) = \sum_\ell p_\ell \log_2 \left( \frac{p_\ell}{m_\ell} \right)
$$

and $m_\ell$ is the frequency of symbol $\ell$ in the average distribution $M$.


#### 4.3.1 Interpretation 💡

* The **Jensen–Shannon distance** quantifies **how different the symbol usage is** between two signals, **ignoring the order** in which the symbols appear.
* It is **bounded between 0 and 1**, symmetric, and always finite (even when some symbols are missing in one sequence).
* A value of **0** indicates identical symbol distributions, while **1** indicates completely disjoint symbol usage.


#### 4.3.2 Use Cases 🧪

* **Robust against misalignment or noise**: two signals with similar overall composition but different positions will still score low JSD.
* **Useful for clustering** symbolic signals by type or composition, regardless of temporal structure.
* **Complementary to entropy or edit-based distances**, which capture positional or morphological changes.




### 4.4 **Jaccard Motif Distance** 🔍

The **Jaccard distance** measures the similarity between two symbolic signals by comparing the sets of **motifs** (short symbolic substrings) they contain, without requiring alignment. It is particularly suited for identifying common structural patterns across signals, regardless of their order or spacing.

Given two sequences $A$ and $B$, and a set of motifs $\mathcal{M}$ of length $k$ (typically 3–5 characters), we define:

* $\mathcal{M}(A)$: set of motifs found in $A$
* $\mathcal{M}(B)$: set of motifs found in $B$

Then the **Jaccard distance** is defined as:

$$
D_{\text{Jaccard}}(A, B) = 1 - \frac{|\mathcal{M}(A) \cap \mathcal{M}(B)|}{|\mathcal{M}(A) \cup \mathcal{M}(B)|}
$$

#### 4.4.1 Key Features:

* ✅ **No alignment needed** — motif presence is evaluated globally
* 🔍 **Sensitive to local patterns** — detects repeated or shared symbolic structures
* 📈 **Sparse and interpretable** — suitable for heatmaps and clustering

#### 4.4.2 Implementation Notes:

* Motifs are extracted using a sliding window of fixed length (default: `k=4`)
* Symbol sequences are assumed to be from the encoded `DNAstr` outputs
* Motif sets are hashed to speed up large comparisons
* Jaccard scores are computed pairwise across a collection of symbolic sequences

This metric is especially useful when:

* You expect **common substructures** across signals
* Signals may differ in length or alignment is unreliable
* You want to create **density maps of motif usage** or explore **structural similarity clusters**

## 🔍 5| Baseline Filtering and Poisson Noise Rejection

> The **Ricker wavelet** $\psi_s(t)$ used in `sig2dna` is mathematically the **second derivative of a Gaussian kernel**. As such, applying the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with $\psi_s(t)$ is equivalent to performing a **second-order differentiation** of the signal $x(t)$ followed by a **Gaussian smoothing**, where the scale parameter $s$ controls the bandwidth.
>
> This structure makes the CWT intrinsically robust to **low-frequency noise**, **baseline drifts**, and **stationary random noise** (such as column bleeding in GC). Moreover, the symmetry of $\psi_s(t)$ ensures suppression of **linear trends**, enhancing signal clarity without distorting peak structures.
>
> For ideal Gaussian-shaped peaks, the optimal CWT response is obtained when the scale $s$ matches the peak's width at its **inflection points**, which corresponds to **half-height** for a Gaussian. This is where the symbolic motif `YAZB` is most cleanly detected.
>
> However, on real-life signals, maximizing noise rejection by increasing $s$ can blur peak details. Preserving the **morphological fidelity** of peaks while ensuring their **detectability** requires operating **near the optimal scale**, not beyond it. To this end, `sig2dna` integrates a **robust preprocessing methodology** tailored for signals acquired through **accumulation or integration** (i.e., **counting statistics**), such as total ion counts in mass spectrometry or spectroscopic intensities.



### Step 1 — Median Baseline Subtraction ﹏𓊝﹏

Let $x(t)$ be the input signal. We compute a moving median over a window of width $w$:

$$
\text{baseline}(t) = \text{median}\left[x(t - w/2), \dots, x(t + w/2)\right]
$$

Then, apply a non-negative correction:

$$
x_b(t) = \max\left(0,\, x(t) - \text{baseline}(t)\right)
$$



### Step 2 — Poisson Noise Estimation ▶︎ ၊၊||၊|။|||| |

From the baseline-corrected signal $x_b(t)$:

* Compute the local mean $\mu(t)$ and standard deviation $\sigma(t)$ using a uniform filter.
* Estimate the coefficient of variation:

$$
\text{cv}(t) = \frac{\sigma(t)}{\mu(t)}
$$

Assuming Poisson noise, infer the local Poisson parameter:

$$
\lambda(t) = \frac{1}{\text{cv}(t)^2}
$$



### Step 3 — Bienaymé–Tchebychev Thresholding 🗑️

To reject noise, use a threshold $T(t)$ derived from $\lambda(t)$:

$$
T(t) = k \cdot \sqrt{10 \lambda(t) \Delta t}
$$

Filtered signal is then:

$$
x_{bf}(t) = 
\begin{cases}
x_b(t) & \text{if } x_b(t) > T(t) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## 🧪 6| Synthetic Signal Generation

Synthetic signals are modeled as a sum of Gaussian/Lorentzian/Triangle peaks. For Gaussian, they read

$$
s(t) = \sum_{i} h_i \cdot \exp\left(-\left(\frac{t - \mu_i}{0.6006 \cdot w_i}\right)^2\right)
$$

where: 

* $h_i$: peak height
* $\mu_i$: center
* $w_i$: peak width (calibrated to Full **Width Half Maximum**)

This is used to:

* Reconstruct symbolic segments
* Generate artificial mixtures
* Simulate motifs for clustering or ML training
* Parses sequences into `YAZB` motif candidates (Mass spectra)

## 📦 13| Installation

### Strategy for 2D or Multi-modal Chromatography 🧭

For **2D chromatographic systems**, such as GC×GC or LC×LC, or in workflows combining retention time and mass detection, we suggest the following dual encoding strategy:

- **Along the retention axis**: perform symbolic encoding of **TIC** (Total Ion Current) or a selected ion trace, to track **retention-based morphology**.
- **Along the $m/z$ axis**: use time-averaged spectra to encode **mass distribution patterns**, capturing molecular-level information.

🔄 This combined coding captures both **substance separation** and **substance identity**, improving both **detection** (peak finding) and **quantification**.



### Substance Identification and Library Matching 🔍 

`sig2dna` includes signal reconstruction capabilities from the symbolic code, allowing for **approximate substance identification** against reference libraries.

However, when precise identification is required:

> ✅ It is preferable to **transform the mass spectra of reference substances using `sig2dna`** and compare them directly to the coded signal.

This enables **symbol-level matching**, which is more robust to noise, shifts, and peak distortion than traditional numerical similarity or library lookup.
